A loose port of [Mobile-Detect](https://github.com/serbanghita/Mobile-Detect) to Lua.

This script will detect the device by comparing patterns against a given User-Agent string. You can find out information about the device rendering your web page:

* mobile or not
* if mobile, whether phone or tablet
* operating system
* [Mobile Grade (A, B, C)](http://jquerymobile.com/gbs/)
* specific versions (e.g. WebKit)

Current `master` branch is using detection logic from **Mobile-Detect@2.8.20**
